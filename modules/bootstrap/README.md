# Warpsys Bootstrap

This directory contains modules that depend on Debian, and a Debian rootfs builder (using mmdebstrap). These modules are used to build the initial utilities that are needed to build other binaries. 

All modules that depend on a Debian rootfs to build should be located in this directory.
